## Geo-Blocker
> A simple, basic, highly customizable, open-source geoblocking application

## Introduction
Geo-Blocker is a set of **minimal code templates** We made to help **YOU** (or other indie devs) **quickly block countries** from accessing your apps/games — *because some local laws are impossible for small teams to comply with*.  
- Have you ever had a time where a country's laws demanded more than your indie team could handle?  
- Have you ever wanted to skip serving regions with weak privacy/IP policies?  
**Then Boy Howdy Geo-Blocker is your escape hatch!**  

## Showcase
Geo-Blocker is a fairly simple and easy to use set of codes, ranging from python implementation, C++(*still under development*), GDScript(*still under development*), 
And Much much more!
Geo-Blocker uses request, json and other built-in code, so you can easily run Geo-Blocker without installing too much bloat!
Geo-Blocker supports multiple country blocking, and offer a simple coding structure so you can easily integrate and scaffold it to other programming language!
The code is highly sorted into blocks, allowing you to implement custom code in between or modifying the main function block! it uses prints to guide you where to modify!
and its compact enough to be used for prototyping!

**Its:**
- ✅ **Production-ready Python scaffold** (copy-paste into your game/app, minimal modification and has an open endpoints to insert custom functions)  
- 🚧 **In-development**: C++, GDScript, and more programming language ports coming soon!  
- ✨ Uses **only built-in libs** (`requests`, `json`) — **zero bloat**  
- 🌍 Blocks **any country** (via your custom GitHub-hosted JSON list(Visit the link on the template to see how it was setup!))  
- ✂️ **Scaffold-friendly**: Code is split into clear blocks with `print()` guides for easy modification  
- ⚡ Compact enough for **prototyping**!

## Abstract
**Geo-Blocker** is an open-source initiative born from the urgent need to help indie developers comply with unreasonably complex local laws (*e.g., data sovereignty mandates, licensing fees, or censorship demands*) that exceed small-team capabilities. Rather than a monolithic library, it delivers language-specific scaffolds — currently Python (production-ready), with C++/GDScript in active development — that provide a complete, copy-paste geoblocking workflow in under 50 lines. Each implementation:
- ✅ Fetches dynamic country blacklists from a centralized JSON source (e.g., GitHub-hosted lists)
- ✅ Checks user location via lightweight IP geolocation (no heavy dependencies)
- ✅ Enforces blocking through customizable termination logic (e.g., tkinter dialogs for desktop apps, engine-specific alerts for games)
- ✅ Guides integration via clear code blocks and debug prints for easy modification

Critically, **Geo-Blocker** does not abstract complexity — it exposes it intentionally. Developers must adapt the scaffold to their stack (*e.g., replacing HTTP calls with engine-native APIs*), making it a deliberately incomplete blueprint for context-aware geoblocking. By prioritizing simplicity over automation and transparency over "magic", it empowers devs to scaffold geographic restrictions into games, desktop apps, or tools without infrastructure bloat — turning legally untenable situations (*e.g., "We can’t serve to UK due to Online Safety Act-like laws we can’t afford to implement"*) into solvable technical tasks. This is not a turnkey solution; it’s the minimal viable pattern for saying "We block here because we must."

## Gaps and Limitation
**Geo-Blocker** is NOT A LIBRARY! its a template, you are required to have atleast some knowledge with your program!
Geo-Blocker does not stop VPN! you can scaffold it yourselves, but since VPN api's are expensive, we prioritize the latter approach of blocking countries, and to provide
**legal shield** in an event where that country ask for you to comply! VPN-blocking is expensive, and not worth implementing!
> A Locks can only block a honest men

> A lock is only a test of honesty.

Geo-Blocker also does track or obtain Data, its open-source, free to modify! therefore fork only here for a reputable and original codebase!

## Documentation and Installation
Geo-Blocker is pretty self-explanatory!
The Backend hosting tempalte layout for a list of blacklisted countries you seek to block is available on the template!
You can copy it, use it or modify it base on what you seek!

it has a print so other program can latch on its prints to execute code accordingly!
it also uses 'ip-view' however you can modify the variable above and the name of the program to customize it yourself, and use a much faster service,
or rename geo-blocker to use other name that fits your ecosystem!

## ENDING
Overall I Hope Geo-Blocker helped you prototype a geo-blocking template!
We are Encouraging you to help us Port Geo-blocker to all coding languages
or improve geo-blocker to support vpn or other edge-cases!

thank you everyone! and have a nice day!
