## BASIC INTRODUCTION
Ahoyyy there! This is the Usage Policy Section for resources/Branding!
GeoBlocker is an **OPEN-SOURCE** Code, You can use it to your likings!
It is shared so if you have any thoughts, you can easily update the Geo-Blocker,
Especially since I'm not really Knowledgeable to Python or other Programming language!
I **ONLY** started and iniated the initiative because of Privacy risk and other local laws from other countries 
that is too demanding to comply, therefore as a easy tape-fix, and waiting for the policy-shift
Geo-Blocker was invented!

## BRANDING USAGE POLICY
